# WiredSwift Client

WiredSwift Client is an implementation of the Wired 2.0 protocol written in Swift. 

## Requirements

* macOS 10.14

## Contribute

You are welcome to contribute using issues and pull-requests if you want to.

Focus is on:

* socket IO stability: the quality of in/out data interpretation and management through the Wired socket
* mutli-threading stability: the ability to interact smoothly between connections and UIs
* low-level unit tests: provides a strong implementation to enforce the integrity of the specification
* specification compliance: any not yet implemented features that require kilometers of code…
* limit regression from the original implementation
